I just wanted to add...
While some companies hack their way to showcase instant SEO results  using unethical and unprofessional practices to derive temporary results at exorbitant price points. Verbat, on the other hand guarantees an organic growth at affordable prices that are sustainable in the long run.

Slide 2
1. Irrespective of weather you choose to use our SEO services, we will build you a portal that is SEO ready, so that you if you choose to work with a different vendor, you can start from where we left off, instead of having to build from scratch
2. We can start building you portal with a traditional form based scheduling system for booking appointments. Verbat is a big proponent of leveraging the power of AI. We can overhaul the form based scheduling system and replace with a chat bot based appointment system that provides a rich user experience. Even better, we can design  a conversational mobile app that can schedule appointments on the patients behalf

Slide 3
1. As stated in the previous slides, we believe in the elegance of simplicity. Therefore  we will propose solutions that follow the KISS principle. We will design the site by organizing the content, layout and navigation to maximize the user experience through rich interactive designs
2. While the site itself shall be developed with traditional search capabilities, if you choose to do so, we can implement a bot based appointment system, they can double up as a search assistant -- responding to almost any question related to the services and practices offered by the hospital. This can be extended to the mobile app as well
3. Our solution has considered the maintainability of many areas of the site that are dynamic. We shall provide an admin portal that can manage these areas
4. As I just mentioned, With Verbat you can be assured that we will partner with you and guide you to navigate the burgeoning technology landscape
