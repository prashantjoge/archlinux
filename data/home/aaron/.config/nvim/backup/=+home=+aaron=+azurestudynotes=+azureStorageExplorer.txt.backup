# Update - StorageExplorer requires .Net Core 2.1
# To check .net core 2.1 runtime support for your OS - Visit this page
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux

# My OS being Archlinux, I had no luck there
# You might also want to check the SDK and runtimes installed for your OS

dotnet --list-sdks
dotnet --list-runtimes

# Fortunately there is AUR.
