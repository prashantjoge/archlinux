StorageExplorer

# Update - StorageExplorer requires .Net Core 2.1
# To check .net core 2.1 runtime support for your OS - Visit this page
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux

# My OS being Archlinux, I had no luck there
# You might also want to check the SDK and runtimes installed for your OS

dotnet --list-sdks
dotnet --list-runtimes

# Fortunately there is AUR. I use trizen (for no particular reason). You may try yay or pacaur
trizen -S dotnet-sdk-2.1 --noconfirm

That seems to have did the trick

Â dotnet --list-runtimes
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.7 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]
Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.21 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]
Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.7 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]

dotnet --list-sdks
2.1.809 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]
3.1.107 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]

# Go ahead fire up StorageExplorer. It should work like a charm
