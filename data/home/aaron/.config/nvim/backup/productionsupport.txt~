Slide 1
Business Scenario
Carrefour, a major retail giant operating in the Middle East approached Verbat to develop a solution to smooth out its logistics operations. Verbat developed a "Pick Pack" solution that was integrated tightly with their existing warehousing  system. The solution consisted of various handheld devices working in concert with back-end systems to provide a rich GUI based interactive dashboard that displayed status's of processes and activities.

The system was capable of tracking activities from its source to its destination, i.e. The movement of stock from the warehouse to the customers doorstep. Along the way, products faced delays, replacements and rejections. Inventory mismatches had to be verified, shortages accounted for etc. These, and numerous other anomalies had to be resolved. While the client had prepared for and had developed workarounds for majority of these issues, they did not have a strategy for addressing issues that they hadn't foreseen nor did they have the resources to support it.

The client requested Verbat to conceive a production support strategy that was time sensitive and commiserate on cost.

Slide 2
The Challenge
Proactive helpdesk for appropriate information routing
24x7 monitoring
Lack of industry standard processes & tools
Change and configuration management
Incident & Problem management
Upgrade & Release management
Application maintenance
Service level management

Slide 3
Tools and processes
Communication: Skype, Slack
Ticketing: Jira
Real time monitoring: Wily
Configuration Management: Starteam
Log search/Analysis: Kibana, Log Stash, Elastic Search
Change management: HP ALM
Job Scheduler: Control-M
Mitigation Tools: CuteFTP, Citrix, Putty, Toad, Query Analyser etc
Repository: Github, svn

Slide 3
Engagement Model
Client(Application Owner) ---> Verbat On-site Manager(1)  -> Verbat On-site Associates (4)
       |
       |--> Verbat Off-site Manager(1) -> Verbat Off-Site Associates (10)
Total on-shore team size (5)
	App Manager - 1
	Level 1 support -1
	Level 2 support - (2 Developers + 1 QA)
Total Off-Shore team size (11)
	App Manager - 1
	Level 3 support - (6 Developers + 2 QA)
	level 4 support - 2

Team Role
Client: Authorize CR, Post implementation review
Verbat On-Site Manager: Approve change request, Incident management, Impact analysis and planning
Verbat On-site Team : Configuration management, Mitigations, Hot Fixes, RCA
Verbat Off-site manager: incident status updates, Release management, Propagate to future release's
Verbat off-site team: code, testing, documentation,

Support Levels
L1 - On-Site team; Classifies issue (type, priority, risk category etc.) and assigns ownership
L2 - On-Site team that resolves the issue using hot-fixes or mitigation scripts
L3 - Resolve tickets that requires code changes (Off-site team)
L4 - Tickets related to products, which require support from vendor

SLA's
P1 - 4 Hrs
P2 - 8 Hrs
P3 - 16 Hrs
P4 - 32 Hrs

Slide 4
Incident management process
client -> raises ticket
	   -> L1 support acknowledges and classifies ticket. Assigns ticket owner
	   -> L2 Identifies ticket resolution(configuration change, mitigation script, other work arounds), Impact analysis and planning for CR, Seek approval and authorization, production Deployment, promote and merge change for upcoming releases
	   -> L3 Bug fix, code change, functional and integration testing. Update CM & code check in.

Slide 5
All graphs should start of with unimpressive stat's. It should get better and better as the team gets familiar with the product.

Dec 2015 - Mar 2017
Graph 1 (Bar chart received, resolved, deferred by month)
Graph 2 (Line Graph by functionality: Picker, Packer, Driver, Master picker: Incidents Service requests )
Graph 3 (Pie Chart: Tickets logged by time: 12 am to 8 pm , 8 am to 5 pm, 5 pm to 12 PM: incidents vs. Service requests)
Graph 4: Average handling time ( It allows you to quantify the efficiency of your day-to-day operation across your support team and ensures your customers’ issues are being dealt with expeditiously.)
Graph 5: First contact resolution time (FCCR involves resolving customer’s issue in one interaction such as in a single chat session, a single phone call, or a single email or social media response. In other words, a customer need not contact you again since the issue was resolved at the first instance.)
Graph 6: Resolution rate (This shows the percentage of issues actually resolved by your agents from the number of total tickets received. It gives you an idea of individual and team efficiency and productivity.)
