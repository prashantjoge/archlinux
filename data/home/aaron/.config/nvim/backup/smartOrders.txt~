Smart Ordering : Going beyond smart inventory management


Introduction

1. Optimizing store replenishment isn't just about keeping the right items in stock. It's  also about perfecting buying.
2. While picking the right suppliers and negotiating the best deals have a central role in good procurement, great savings can also be made day-to-day, long after the suppliers have been chosen and terms agreed on.
3. With Smart Ordering, Verbat intends to introduce a level of intelligence that is ubiquitous to all verticals in retail goods procurement
