6 PRINCIPLES of AWS WELL ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK

1. Stop guessing your capacity needs: Instead of guessing, with AWS you can scale up & down according to your needs
2. Test Systems at production scale: Allows your to reproduce production scale capacities in development. You can shut them down when you are done. So you can test fully before you go live without having to incur a huge financial footprint
3. Lower the risk of architecture change:
4. Automate to make architecture experimentation easier
5. Allow for evolutionary architecture: Automate & test on demand. New innovations can be implemented easily

PILLARS OF AWS WELL ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK
1. Security: Ability to protect information, systems & assets while delivering business value through risk assessments & mitigation strategies. I.e. Apply security at all layers. E.g. Firewalls, security groups, RBAC's. Traceability, auditing (CloudTrail), automate security responses and best practices through custom baseline images.
2. Reliability: Ability of a system to recover from infra or service failures, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfiguration & transient network issues
3. Performance Efficiency: Ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, & to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technology evolves
4. Cost Optimization: Eliminate sub unneeded costs or suboptimal resources
5. Operational Excellence: refers to operational practices and procedures used to manage production workloads

SECURITY IN THE CLOUD
1. Data protection:
        a. Categorize data based on sensitivity
        b. Grant least privilege
        c. Encryption to protect sensitive data (IAM, KMS)
        d. Detailed logging using CloudTrail
        e. Resilient storage using S3
        f. Use versioning and life cycle management (S3)
2. Privilege management - IAM:
        a. Access control list: document that lists access permissions attached to an object
        b. Role based access control list (RBAC): Permissions for a particular end users role or function
        c. Password management: complexity management and change intervals
3. Infrastructure protection
        a. MFA - Multi factor authentication: Stateful or stateless packet inspection
        b. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enforces boundry protection & monitors points of egress and ingress
        c. Cloud trail & cloud watch for logging, monitoring & alerting
4. Detective controls
        a. Cloud trail logs API calls
        b. Cloud watch is a monitoring AWS resources, disks, n/w acitvity, database & volumes
        c. AWS config is an inventory and configuration history service
        d. AWS S3 records the details of access requests
        e. Amazon Glacier uses the vault lock feature to preserve critical data

RELIABILITY
1. Test Recovery strategy
2. Automatic failure recovery
3. Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
4. Stop guessing capacity

ACHIEVING RELIABILITY in THE CLOUD
1. Foundations
    a. Sufficient bandwidth (AWS takes care of this by default)
    b. Sufficient compute capacity (Same as above)
    c. Trained staff (Can be arranged by AWS)
    d. Support Contracts (Same as above)
2. Change management
    a. Plan pro actively
    b. Monitor
    c. Automatic response to KPI's
3. Failure management
    a. Frequent automated testing (Cloud formations to launch temp copies of system to verify recovery process)
    b. Recovery (CloudWatch - automation to react to monitoring data in case of failure)
    c. Store data in Amazon S3 for future use

PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY
1. Democratize advanced technologies
2. Go global in minutes
3. Use Serverless activities
4. Experiment more often

ACHIEVING PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY IN THE CLOUD
1. Compute
2. Storage
3. Database
4. Space-Time Trade-Off

COST OPTIMIZATIONS
1. Transparently attribute expenditure
2. Managed services to reduce the operational cost of ownership
3. Trade capital expense for operational expense
4. Benefit form economies of scale
5. Stop spending money on data centre operations

Cost Optimization on the cloud is composed of
1. Matched supply and demand: Monitoring tools, regular benchmarking
2. Cost-effective resources: AWS trusted advisor helps to choose between On-demand instances, Reserved instances, Spot instances, Amazon RDS or Dynamo DB
3. Expenditure awareness: Cost allocation tags, cost allocation reports, Billing alerts, AWS Simple Monthly calculator
4. Optimizing over time:

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
1. Perform operations with code
2. Align operations process to business objectives
3. Make regular, small incremental changes
4. Test for responses to unexpected events
5. Learn from operational events and failures
6. Keep operational procedures current

Operational Excellence in the cloud
1. Preparation (AWS CloudFormations, Automated Scaling, AWS Config, AWS Trusted Advisor)
    a. Operations Checklists
    b. Runbooks & playbooks
    c. Routine reviews
    d. Mechanism to learn from failures
    e. Documented configurations
2. Operations (CI/CD pipelines, release management process, Risk mitigation strategies)
    a. Automation: small frequent changes can be easily made
    b. Regular QA
    c. Changes - are not large & infrequent, do not require scheduled downtime, do not require manual execution
    d. Defined Mechanisms - track, audit, roll back & review

3. Responses


PLANNING AND DESIGNING
1. Scaling:
2. Loose Coupling
3. Redundancy
4. Cost Optimization
5. Automation
6. Security

AMAZON VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (VPC)
---------------------------------------
Topics
1. Amazon VPC
2. Public, private & Elastic IP addresses
3. Public & private subnets
4. Internet gateways
5. Route tables
6. NAT gateway
7. Security groups
8. Network ACLs
9. VPC Best Practices
10. Costs
----------------------------------------

VPC TERMINOLOGY
----------------------------------------
AWS Direct Connect: Establish a direct connection between AWS & your data centre.This will reduce network cost, increase b/w, consistent n/w experience with port speeds from 50M to 10G but more expensive

VPC: Virtual private cloud allows you to launch Amazon Web Services (AWS) into a virtual n/w that you have defined.
