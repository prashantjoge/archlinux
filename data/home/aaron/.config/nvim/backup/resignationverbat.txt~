Dear Dev / Saju,
This is to let you know that I intend to resign from Verbat by August 31st. I hope that you can relieve me from my duties by then. I have thought long and hard about this decision, but a logically better option escapes me.

You might very well recall the circumstances that lead to my employment at Verbat. I was entreated with the option of being a part of something bigger than me and I accepted it lock, stock and barrel. My journey with Verbat was reminiscent of some of the best experiences in my life. In more ways than one Verbat has furnished me with kindness, friendship and camaraderie I am deeply thankful for that. In an ideal world I would have wanted to continue this journey, unfortunately we have to make choices in life that are often less than ideal.

Without going into too many details, suffice it to say that the pay scale offered by Verbat simply doesn't provide for my means. Aside from that, I strongly believe that a salary is not just a number. It is also an indicator of one's value within an organization. The ensemble of skills that I profess, my unmitigated commitment to quality and my indomitable spirit towards achieving goals with hard work, dedication and passion has no more value than the mundane. Ever so often a thank you would have been nice, but even that is a JOB (regretfully) at Verbat. I sought to be more than a statistic...


In light of the above, it is hard for me to continue to serve Verbat. I wish the very best for Verbat in it's future ventures.

I am not writing this with anger, malice or resentment and it is not the emotion that I seek to evoke either. Mincing words was not part of my repertoire and I wish I could apologize to everyone who had to bear the brunt of my vexation. I take leave from you with respect, gratitude and appreciation

Regards

Prashant
