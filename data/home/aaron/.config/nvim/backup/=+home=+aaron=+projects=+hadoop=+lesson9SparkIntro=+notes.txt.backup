RDDs are created by referencing external datasets. Examples are reduce,join, filter & map.
Spark SQL lies on top of Spark Core. It introduces SchemaRDD. It supports SQL with ODBC /JDBC server and command line interfaces
Spark Streaming
MLLIB : Distributed machine learning library
GraphX : Distributed graph processing f/w
