I.INTRODUCTION

In the digital age, information is key. The speed  and efficiency at which information is dispersed can enhance communication between individuals and communities. This is witnessed by Apps like WhatsApp and Skype. However this fails when a call to action is required to create brand awareness or worse still when emergency relief operations require structured directions. In the past the government employed mass media outlets like land lines or televisions to broadcast emergency information to citizens. Consider other scenarios; information about general elections, information and activities related to local festivals, cautioning commuters to follow the local traffic laws, Directions  and procedures to complete various activities in government offices. While these are challenges, in our mad frenzy to disseminate information, we've forayed into a wide variety of activities that contribute towards environmental pollution. Some examples are; Noise pollution in the form of insanely loud high wattage speakers, air & water pollution followed by deforestation through the indiscriminate use of paper for advertisements and propaganda.

Its time to relegate such outdated practices and embrace an environmentally friendly approach that addresses these shortcomings. One approach is to develop a Distributed Digital Signage System that is cheap, affordable and reliable. This is possible because of the emergence of cheap digital displays, single board computers like Raspberry (computer on a chip), the availability of cheap wireless-broadband and the increased sophistication & wide adoption of numerous open standards in the World Wide Web. While many companies have taken advantage of these factors to float Distributed Digital Signage Systems, they lack the nimbleness to scale the disparity between micro, small and medium to large enterprises.

II. What is a Distributed Digital Signage System?

Digital signage is a widely-used terminology for digital displays with a centrally managed multimedia content that is used for conveying advertising, informational, entertainment, and commerce messages to a target audience . Digital signage was initially a standalone display situated in a specific location with an attached computing device that enabled the playing of multimedia content. This content could be changed/updated as needed by an operator who would physically access the display, manually remove the old content, and install the new content. Advances in network technology are now enabling digital signage to be physically distributed and pervasive making its deployment and management relatively easier; for example now replacing content can be done remotely through a network. These network-attached digital signage systems are commonly referred to as distributed digital signage systems.

In general, a distributed digital signage system consists of four major components: hardware, software, network, and content. The hardware component, in general, comprises of a digital display (e.g. monitor or LCD television) and a computing device connected to the display that stores and plays the multimedia content. The computing device also has a communication port for sending and receiving data through the network. The software component for a digital signage system  comprises of a content management system (CMS), remotely situated in some server, that holds all content to be displayed; a multimedia player in the digital signage unit for visualizing the content; and a local content manager also in the digital signage unit that periodically checks the CMS for any new content, retrieves it, and replace the displayed content with the newly retrieved content. The network component for a digital signage system usually employs the existing network infrastructure of the current organization or institution. Lastly, the content component for a digital signage system is typically a combination of audio, image, and/or video elements. The contents range from advertising and marketing messages to public information for communities, governments, and public institutions. How these elements are packaged and structured are usually proprietary and developed specifically for the system. Moreover, this package and structure are closely tied to the CMS and multimedia player that is being used by the system.

Distributed Digital Signage Systems are more prevalent in developed countries; insufficient work has been done to adapt and implement these systems in developing countries. Verbat intends to change that by developing a system that shall allow for the rapid sourcing of local components, spare parts and expertise. This can be achieved by using open hardware devices and open sourced software that are widely familiar to local skilled workers.

III. Generic System Architecture (A brief overview)

The architecture for the proposed system consists of three nodes: a server, an access point, and a digital signage unit. The deployment diagram for the architecture is depicted in Fig. 1. The server can be a single machine or a collection of machines in a server farm. Content may be uploaded, stored, and managed in the server by a content administrator. The digital signage unit is placed in an area that is visible to its target audience and consists of a display to show the intended content and a single board computer to locally store the content and to control the display. The display is any COTS monitor or television, which can be purchased in any consumer electronic store, that has a connector (preferably, an HDMI connector but not mandatory) that is supported by the single board computer, in order for the computer to be able to control the display. The single board computer can be any open hardware device (e.g. Raspberry Pi) but must have a built-in Wi-Fi module so that it can connect to the access point to access the Internet and communicate with the server to retrieve any needed content. Lastly, the access point can also be any COTS Wi-Fi access point that supports the 802.11x standard.

 In this architecture, all content will be in HTML5 format. HTML5 based technologies are sufficiently mature to enable the creation of very sophisticated content and visualization, especially when combined with CSS3 and JavaScript(ES6). Moreover, by using HTML there is no need to create a proprietary editor for the content or to retrain content creators. As an added feature, by adopting the Progressive Web App (PWA) approach, the content can automatically adjust to different screen sizes without the need to create different versions for different screen sizes. From the software perspective, as with other distributed digital signage systems, this architecture consists of two major components; An App resides in the digital signage unit and a server side App resides in the server. The server shall run a CMS in order to manage all content in the system. The function of this CMS is not only to distribute, manage, and store all relevant content but also to inform the digital signage units of any new content so that the content can be retrieved by the unit. Because the content is in HTML, any popular browser that has plugin support to play media will can be employed.

The architecture description of the system referenced above will suffice for most use cases. It is cheap and reliable. However, for a more robust system where the signage devices need to be managed remotely or when information needs to be dispersed intelligently depending on context (e.g. emergency relief versus advertisements  in malls; situations where there is a need to control the dispersion of media to specific devices; when each display device has distinct content), a slightly more complex system may be required. The reminder of the document discuses these scenarios in detail. Please note that, this alternate architecture does not deviate too far from the core principles that have already been discussed.

IV. The need for a more sophisticated solution

While the initial focus had been on cheap and reliable information dispersion, the system has enormous commercial potential. A few use cases to consider are:

	A. In transportation centres—airports, train stations, subways—digital signs keep travellers on schedule while also displaying revenue-producing advertising.
	B. In schools and on college campuses, digital signs are the new channel for communicating with students, replacing printed calendars and bulletin boards;they also play a role in the all-important emergency alerting system.
	C. In high-volume, quick-service restaurants, digital signs help streamline the ordering process and offer customers a way to interact via their smart phones.
	D. In hotels and resorts, digital signage is an easy and flexible way to provide guests with information about services and activities on and off the property—information that drives greater use of these services and delivers on the bottom line.

It is clear from these examples, digital signage offers significant advantages over conventional signage and posters, which have to be designed and printed well in advance. With digital signage you can adapt messaging on the fly. Different content can appear on different screens at different times and different places. You can also have live feeds from TV, the Web, databases and more. While this dynamic flexibility is a huge advantage, if you think of digital signs as simply a replacement for posters and billboards, you are making a mistake. Digital signage is so pervasive; it is looked upon as a new medium, often referred to as the “fifth screen” (after film, TV, the PC and the mobile device). In fact, many organizations that have digital signs have chosen to accept third-party advertising on them, creating another revenue stream.
