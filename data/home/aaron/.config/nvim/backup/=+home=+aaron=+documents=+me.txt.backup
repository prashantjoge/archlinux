Prelude to a dream

First of all, let me give you a little perspective. I have been working in software development for the last 20 years or so. I am acutely interested in trying to understand the human mind. Questions like can consciousness exist independent of its substrate? Can we impart consciousness to artificial intelligence? If we could, that would make us Gods of the new millennium. I am not going dwell there for obvious reasons and I do not wish to bore you with my research. Suffice it to say that I spend huge amounts of time at work. Even when I am at home, I live on a different planet. Obviously this causes a lot of friction in my family life. But I can't help it. I am so thirsty. On to my story.

Life has always been a string of embarrassing incidents for me. I think my first recollection of this was when I was 10 years old. My parents had purchased a new home and my mom's extended family came to visit us. I remember clearly, on the second day of their stay, my mom's sisters pulled me to the side and requested me to pull down my shorts . It was a strange request and I felt uncomfortable, but I complied. They looked at my penis and then they looked at each other. They were a bit surprised, but it seemed like they were expecting it. They didn't say much other than to whisper "Oh my god" with a tight smile . They left me at that and promptly told me to never mention this to my mom. I never did. You should know that my mom had a loving family and they never meant to humiliate me. I think the word got around that I had a small penis and they were just curious. They never made fun of me or said anything disparaging. But the incident had a profound implications on my life. For the first time I realized that I was abnormal. I knew that my penis was small. I really didn't know how to process this information. Obviously, the last thing on a 10 year old's mind is sex or the consequences of a small penis.

I now know that penis size is not everything. Especially after men and women reach a certain age. But so much happens in between, right?

I grew up in boarding schools most of my life. I really missed my parents during those years. I am sure this is not true for everyone, but I was different.

Lonely.

I couldn't make friends like the others. I lacked self confidence. I needed encouragement. Lots of it, but received none. During those years, I found myself doing bad at almost everything.

Sports, Studies, cultural competitions. You name it. I didn't have the skills to compete. My life was awkward at best. Don't get me wrong, It wasn't that gloomy and pale. I had my occasional laughs. Had a few reliable friends. A girl fell in love with me, but I was too shy to reciprocate.

13 was the next turning point in my life. It was the age of video cassettes. I can still remember the day I walked into a video library. I was browsing for a good movie to watch. What I saw stood out like the colour pink. It was a fully blown x-rated movie. I stood there riveted, my eyes transfixed, heart pumping a 100 beats per minute,throat parched and excited beyond words. I borrowed the movie, half afraid that I would be checked for my age at the counter. I watched the movie after my parents had gone to sleep. Thus started a new age for me. The age of porn. I have never been able to shrug of that love affair.

Normally this would have been a passing phase for boys my age. Not for me!!! You see, my parents were extremely religious Catholics. From a young age I was taught that sex outside marriage was wrong. That set in motion a chain of events that completely took my life in a different direction. I rationalized that watching porn was the lesser sin than fornication. But the clincher was not that. By watching porn, my perspective changed. I became a voyeur. Never a participant. Even in my fantasies, I was a voyeur, never a participant. I was piggy backing on the notion that even in my fantasies, by being a voyeur, I was committing a lesser sin (The lies that we tell ourselves to feel good about ourselves!!!).

So far so bad!!!. I was already suffering emotionally from low self confidence because I had no support structure. I knew I had a small penis. Add to that, my preference for being a voyeur in sexual encounters. I was an emotional wreck. My life was a roller-coaster. In the mean time I was also diagnosed as a bi-polar. I had great days - productive days, which were followed by sulking - I wrote poems during those days. It helped me a great deal.

In my 30's, you could say that I was a confirmed cuckold (not practising though). I mean, I knew what it was, and it was the only fantasy to which I could get off. I stumbled upon a cuckold story. I did not even know that there was a porn genre for it. But I found myself reading similar stories before it finally dawned on me. All the dots finally connected. This was also the time that I got married. It was a marriage of convenience. I wasn't really attracted to her. She was attractive in the traditional sense, but something was missing. She was tame, a real catholic. There was no chemistry, I married her because our families gained a whole lot because of the marriage.

The marriage was a sham. It didn't last more than a year. We went our separate ways on grounds of mutual incompatibility.

When I was around 35, I met Jessica. She was everything I was not, perky and energetic, full of kind words and gestures. She was only 22, but with a huge burden on her shoulders. She was the caretaker for her sister Amy. Their mother had passed away when Amy was only 6 - in a tragic car accident. Jessica had to take  on the role of her mother at the young age of 18. To make it worse their father passed away a few years later. He has undiagnosed cancer. Despite the dire circumstances, Jessica was unusually upbeat  and had a spring to her step. Amy was 10 years old when I met Jessica. She was a precocious young girl who seemed to be mature beyond her years.

Jessica was a darling. The first time I saw her, I felt guilty just looking at her. I felt like I was doing something wrong. Like a little boy stealing cookies. I was smitten by her. Jessica worked as an insurance adjuster. She had to travel often to process claims. But most of the time she didn't have to travel too far. She was normally back home by the end of the day. Once or twice a month, she would have to travel out of state.

I had to count on everything in my reserves to get myself to ask her out. She smiled infectiously, but there was a mystery to it. I almost felt crestfallen knowing that she was going to make an excuse. But thankfully, she accepted.

"It's a date then" She said, as her arms almost graced mine.

They were soft, just the brush of her hand made me nervous. To say that she was above my league was an understatement. I felt anxious and my palms were sweating from the excitement

We met at a diner. Both of us wanted to keep it casual; not wanting to send any mixed signals to each other. Or, that's what I thought I was doing. The truth was, I didn't want to feel rejected. Making it casual would give her no reason to say anything negative. I was surprised to find that she was not alone. Her little sister Amy was with her. Looking back, it was probably the best, because it made the conversation lighter and easier. We spend more that an hour chatting. In retrospect, I think Jessica wanted to ensure that I was comfortable with her sister. She later told me that her sister was going to be a permanent feature in our relationship. At least until she was old enough to be on her own. It didn't bother me at all. In fact I thought I was getting some bonus points. Not all men would accept the additional baggage.

During the first couple of months in our relationship we played it casual. We would occasionally meet each other. In time, she started to treat me as a close friend, even confiding in me occasionally.

It was during this time that I started having recurring dreams on the same subject. I guess you could say it was kinky but, that's not how I felt in the dream.

My first dream involved me marrying a princess (literally). Except I didn't feel like I deserved her. We were surrounded by rich and powerful people (men mostly).I felt like an insect among them. She was wearing a traditional wedding dress. I found myself alone in the crowd. She was having a great time chatting up with everyone. It's weird, because normally you mingle after the wedding.

Eventually it was the ordained time and I found myself standing next to her in the church. When the ceremony was over I turn to my bride to kiss her. She looked at me and smiled expectantly. I grabbed her face and smooched her lips like there was no tomorrow. In my heart, I was claiming her for myself from the rich and powerful people surrounding us. Her lips were sweet and supple. But he next thing I know, we are back to where we were, blending with the crowd. I hardly get a chance to talk to her. I felt like a wall flower. I tried to attach myself to a group, but my tongue was stuck to the roof of my mouth. I had nothing to contribute. They sounded posh, sophisticated, so elegant and fashionable.

As the guest scattered for the evening, I walked back to my room. I see that her father is sitting on a desk doing something but he hardly acknowledges me. I wonder why he is in my room. I lie on the bed waiting for my wife. After a while she came in, but she was not alone. She was accompanied by a handsome man. She looked excited, yearning for something different. I heard her say "Its been a long time..." and looked at him expectantly. Next thing I know, I see him flopping on the bed completely naked right next to me. I can't take my eyes of his penis. It was really big and thick and completely erect. As he settles on the bed, I feel like his penis touching my thighs. (Don't ask me how, dreams don't make sense) and she walks to the bathroom. I look at him and he has a smug expression on his face. He wasn't exactly condescending or looking down at me. It felt more like, that was the expected thing to do. Like that was his right.

I got up from the bed and walked towards the balcony. I found myself with tears streaming down my face. Suddenly, I woke up with my heart pounding and my mind conflicted. I thought I would get a hard on but instead I was depressed. I dwelled on the dream and kept trying to reminisce the abject feeling of sadness and humiliation. This time while in my conscious mind, I found an erotic discharge that caroused my body. I am hard. I masturbated 3 times that day.

 In my second dream, I found myself extremely attracted to a girl with flushy red cheeks. She was young and pretty with a certain innocence about her. But I knew that she was promiscuous. I try to win her attention by visiting her with lots of gifts. She accepts them and I find myself sleeping next to her. I do manage to lay some kisses on her cheek. But I can't seem to make any progress beyond that, even though she is lying right next to me naked. Then I notice visitors walking into the house. They are just hanging out. Some of them trash the gifts I brought for her. Others simply use them. As I get up to meet them, I feel like some of them have a scowl etched on their face. I figure, I should leave with what's left of my stuff. But there is nothing left. The next instant I woke up. Again my heart is thudding but I can't take her face out of my mind.

 Normally I can hardly recollect dreams. They fade away within the first few minutes after I wake up. But these dreams didn't. It nagged on me. I figured it must be  a recollection of one of the stories that I had read, Or maybe it had some deeper meaning related to my psyche or perhaps a premonition of things to come.

If you can find yourselves vested in my story so far, you should know that the narrative account that follows is the stuff of imagination. You might want to take it with a pinch of salt, but rest assured, they are as real as the flesh on your bones.

Getting back to my life with Jessica or Jez.  That's what I used to call her.

Jez and I started seeing each other more frequently as the days wore on. We were getting pretty comfortable with each other. A lot of the time Amy would join us on our dates. We were not married, but I felt like they were my family. Like I mentioned earlier, Jez was my polar opposite. She had friends galore. As I got to know her, I became accustomed to meeting her friends in public. I tried my best to be part of her group. Although at times, no matter how much I tried, I just knew that I  couldn't fit in. I even mentioned this to her. She told me not to worry, but to take it in stride. She knew about my low self-esteem and tried her best to include me in her conversations.

We dated for two years. Towards the latter part of it we became more intimate. By intimate, I don't mean to say that we engaged in full fledged intercourse; rather we permitted ourselves to pet each other. Very rarely she would allow me to caress her  naked ass and thighs. She wouldn't wear her under things on those specially reserved occasions.So I had free reign to access her delicate calves and thighs through the material of her dress. I know that this might sound weird, given that most couples would engage in coitus after the first couple of dates. The thing is, I always viewed her as a delicate flower. Hold her too closely and I might squash her. So, early on in our relationship I tried to be her provider and her constant source of support; I yearned to serve her and she loved me for that. Initially she respected my religious convictions and tried her best to not seduce me. Later on, it almost appeared like she brought my convictions stock, lock and barrel. She was the one reminding me not to  cross that imaginary threshold. Of course, the real reason why I wasn't too keen on pushing the cover was because years of reading and fantasizing about cuckold porn had numbed my senses. I masturbated constantly thinking of Jez, but I was never in the picture. So, even if she did make herself available to me, there was a good chance that I was already spent. In the odd chance I wasn't, I had to close my eyes and imagine that she was with some one else. So, I was more than OK with the occasional petting.

As we got closer, We started trading personal war stories, our ups and downs in life. I freely admitted that I was a virgin. When I asked about her past, she politely declined

"Honey, we don't need to exorcise our past demons. Let the dead dogs be"

She gave me a wry smile and left it at that. The last thing I could imagine was to believe that she had a sexual past. I mean, in the last few years that I had known her, she had been anything but the chaste girlfriend doting on her little sister.

Getting married to Jez was the best decision of my life. We finally got hitched after 4 years of courtship. I was 39 years old and Jez was 26 yours young. Although I was more than a decade older than her, she said that my youthful looks didn't bring out the sharp contrast in our age. It was the happiest day of my life. Unfortunately, honeymoon was out of the question, because Jez had some commitments at work. Even though her boss had given her the green flag, she refused to bite, citing multiple reasons. One of which happened to be her concern for leaving Amy alone. Although I personally thought that Amy was mature enough to manage herself (she was 14 now). I was actually really relieved when the idea of honeymoon was dropped, because I was getting really nervous. I had a ton of things going in my head - mostly I feared my sexual inability to please Jez. But my fears were allayed because my Jez was so sweet to me. She never pushed me to consummate our relationship. The first couple of days we kissed a lot and petted each other. Although there was a storm brewing in my head on when the dam of her patience would break. During those early days, I made it a point to not watch any porn, even though the figments of my imagination were running wild. One day as we kissed and fooled around she felt for my penis. Alarm bells ran through my mind. Not only was I small, I was neither getting fully hard. Thankfully I played my favourite sex scenario in my head. My penis became instantly hard. She was frisky and tugged it a couple of times and she whispered to me

"Oh baby, you are so hard" I was pleased and I kissed her. She quickly hoisted herself on top of me and started grinding her sex on my penis. Before long she dropped forward and inserted my penis in her sweet opening. It was actually a bit painful because I had never managed to break my prepuce. The pain had immediately registered on my face. She noticed and stroked my cheeks.

"Are you sure you are OK. Am I doing something wrong?"

I had to console her and ask her to keep going. She increased her rhythm and my pain was overcome by a quick burst of intense orgasm. I tried my best to contain myself but it was of no use.

"I am sorry" I cried out as my orgasm over took me

"sssshhhh... Its OK baby... We have the rest of the night to catch up" She said it with a glint in her eye.

Sure enough, I did manage to come two more times. But it still was not enough to get her off.

"Don't worry baby... I promise you. One of these days you are going give me the best orgasm in my life. I know it..." She ruffled my hair and pinched my nose smiling.

We spooned that night and slept contently.

She was right though, and our sex life improved dramatically. I never became the super star on the bed, but I had what it took to give her a real orgasm. In the off times I couldn't, she taught me how to please her with my tongue. Life was finally good.

I was doing good as a professor. I had become tenured and there was enough grant money coming in to keep my research going for another 5 years easily. That was when we decided to start a family. We had been married for 2 years by then. It was perfect. Amy had turned 16 and she was almost home free. Jez was getting a bit nervous about hitting her 30's. She wanted to have a child by then. She was not on the pills and I had said good bye to condoms. We had sex regularly and I was really hoping to become the father of a baby girl. I really wanted a baby girl just like my wife.

We tried for a couple of months but she was not getting impregnated. We decided to make an appointment with a gynaecologist. Jez was insistent that I be with her. The Doctor examined her. We chatted as she took notes on our medical history. Finally she wanted to know if my wife was on any contraceptives. Jez, fished out from her handbag a prescription. The doctor checked it and told Jez that she might have to give herself a couple more months for her hormones to get regulated.

I was a bit surprised by this revelation. I was always under the impression that I was the active partner in our family planning initiatives and I voiced my concern. Her reply was very uncharacteristic and had an edge to it.

"Honey, one can never be sure..." She paused "You know...". The doctor agreed with her and affirmed that it was a good decision.

On our way home, we were both eerily silent. I decided not to read too much into it and came to terms with it. After all she was the most precious thing that happened in my life and I had no interest in picking a squabble over something so insignificant. I tried to spoon and snuggle next to her but I felt like she was keeping a distance. It was nothing, but I felt a heaviness descenting over me.

The next day I couldn't really put my mind to work. I felt tired even though I hadn't done anything. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep the night before. I was browsing the news on google and I came across an article on a business called Sanctum (snctm) being bought out by the Circle Group. The article was sidelined by a scantily clad image of a man and women. The man was wearing horns on his head. You can imagine the image that rushed to my head. I clicked on the link out of curiosity. It took me to a site called www.snctm.com. Apparently it was a sex club for the ultra rich. There were even some videos posted on the site. It got my gears rolling. All of those morbid thoughts that I had siloed away was erupting like a volcano. My vicarious nature was rapidly taking control over me. In my office cabin I found myself pouring over all the old x-rated cuckold sites that I had said goodbye to. I ended up masturbating sitting in my office chair and I hated myself for it. I felt like something had been snuffed out of me. (I have complete privacy in my cabin. My lab is large and I have separate areas allocated for graduate students and PHD students.)

When I got home, Jez was still not in. I was used to her working late but Amy was there listening to some music on her earphones. She greeted me absent mindedly. I was about to head upstairs, when she hollered after me

"Hey Pete, Jez is going to be late today. She asked you to not wait up."

"Oh k. Any idea when she would be back?"

"I don't know. She said that she was catching up with some old friends"

"Aright. I have to finish up some work. I'll see you later"

I wasn't even thinking straight any more. I headed straight for my study and fired up my computer. I rarely used the computer when Jez was not at home. But this time it was different. I almost felt like my horns were growing back. I had no hope left any more. I found myself resurrecting all of my abandoned thoughts and habits. Predictable I shagged again. To drown the sadness I poured my self two stiff drinks. Eventually I fell asleep. I had no idea when Jez got home. The next morning as I woke up, I noticed that Jez was already up. I got dressed up and wheeled myself down the staircase. There was a hot pot of coffee brewing and I helped myself to it. Jez was already in the kitchen. She smiled and offered me some breakfast. Lightly toasted bread with poached eggs. My favourite. She sat down with me on the breakfast table.

"How was yesterday, Hon?" I asked while sipping the coffee

"It was fabulous. You remember Jack from the west side. We met him last Christmas"

"Oh yeah, sure... How is he?"

"He is doing real good. We met at the Masa. I am so glad we could catch up" she smiled disarmingly

"Masa huh, That must have put a dent in our account" Masa is one of the most expensive restaurant in New York. I had dined there once a few years back because I loved Japanese food. The bill was $1500 for a single meal.

"Oh no. He was paying. He never lets anyone pay for anything. That's just his thing. He is a really nice guy, you know.." She trailed of and patted my hands. Like she was trying to disarm me and show affection

I felt warm and fuzzy just seeing her smile. The ice was broken. She was back.

"Was he always rich? Or..." I enquired.

"Oh yeah... He has old money. His grandpa owns a thousand acres. They say that some of his land has been leased out to the oil companies. They are fracking his land for oil."

"I wish my grandpa had some of that"

"Well we can't have it all. We've got each other. Not everyone has that" I was elated by that thought

"You are so right babe. I love you so much" I got up and hugged her tight.

The previous night was a blur and I swore to myself that I would never venture that way again. I drove to work and I was a happy camper. Things went back to normal for the next couple of weeks. But it was short lived. We had the next doctors appointment for Jez. This time the Doctor drew blood. She wanted to ensure that there was nothing wrong with Jez. A couple of days later the results were out and the Doctor's office informed Jez that there was nothing wrong with her.

"Babe, The doctor wants to run a few tests on you. You know... Just for precaution" She lingered. It was more of a statement than an opinion.

"Sure Hon. I'll go see my doctor"

"No... Pete, Lets just go to my doctor's office. They also have an endocrinologist there. We can get the complete picture in one shot"

"Sure babe. Anything you say" I agreed reluctantly. To be honest I wanted some privacy on the matter.

The doctors office was a nightmare. I had to meet with a urologist, endocrinologist and a gynaecologist. They literally punctured my arms with needles on top of having to provide semen for analysis. I almost swore on my wife

"I can't believe I am stuck in this fuck up" I glared

"Sweetie, it's for the best. We need to get to the root of this. I need you to support me on this" She trailed off hesitantly

"I just... OK fine... But, I am not coming back here again"  I was a bit exasperated.

"I hope so too baby. I'm sure everything is going to be fine" she said hopefully

We were stuck in the Doctor's office for over 6 hours. At the end of which my wife suggested that we go out for a quiet dinner and some drinks to relieve the stress.

Dinner was good. I really needed it. As usual I couldn't stop staring at her. After knowing her for over 6 years, I was still  ensnared by her beauty. We decided to go for drinks at a local hotspot. They had a decent dance floor, some game slots and a few poker tables. I didn't care too much for the place but it was home base for Jez. She loved to hangout there.

We had a few drinks and I was feeling buzzed.

"Jez, I love you so much" I blurted out sheepishly.

"I love you too babe" she replied, even though it felt like more out of courtesy.

She held out her hand inviting me to the dance floor. I wasn't much of a dancer but on this occasion I was game for anything. As we were dancing, I couldn't help but notice other men eyeing her, but she had her eyes on me the whole time and we were slow dancing.

"Do you really love me babe" She asked me

I didn't know how to answer that question. If only she knew!!!

"I do. You know that" I said glumly, fearing that I was not convincing enough.

"I know, but I just need to hear it more often. Sweetie, I don't want to embarrass you but you forgot to turn of your computer the other day."

I looked at her perplexed.

"It was a bit too much and I don't understand why you left it that way." I could see a hint of resentment on her lips.

"I... I am sorry... I don't remember. I mean.. " I was stumbling for excuses.

"It wasn't me. Amy saw it. I wish you had exercised more discretion. She is just a kid you know"

I couldn't read her thoughts. Was she angry? Was she sad? Any chance that she might be forgiving? There was no way I could bail out of this one.

"I'm really sorry babe. Truly...."

"Don't babe me. Just... Just don't say anything... You are someone else. I don't know you any more" The timber of her voice was low. But I knew that sound. She was more than mad. She walked away from me straight out of the club.

I followed her like a wet puppy. She got in the car and I drove not daring to speak another word.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two days later we were still not in speaking terms. I tried my best to open a channel to communicate. Worse still, I was embarrassed every time I saw Amy. It seemed like the world was turning against me again.

The lab results couldn't come at a more inopportune time. I visited the doctor's office on my own. Jez refused to join me.

"I'm sorry to say this to you Mr. Peter, but your sperm has low motility and your body is also producing anti-sperm antibodies. I am guessing you suffered from some kind of trauma or infection...."  He was waiting for me to fill in the blanks

"I've had mumps when I was a kid" I used to hear that all the time from my peers in school. When ever someone got mumps it was common talk among the kids about low sperm production. We used to make fun of each other whenever someone got mumps.I know many friends who had mumps as kids but they lead normal lives. But that was in the distant past. I was only 8 years old.

"Hmm.. That could be it. Don't worry though there is some good news. There are several treatments available, but We'll have to do more tests to know the exact nature of your problem. There is a thirty to sixty percent chance that we can rectify this, but I just can't promise you anything."

"Why don't you discuss this with your wife. The treatment is expensive, but I am guessing your insurance should cover it"

Nice. I thought to myself as I left the doctor's office. I must have willed this all to myself. Why did I get mumps? Why was I singled out. Why is life being such a bitch to me. I wondered how I was going to explain this to my wife. Would she think any less of me? Stupid idiot of a husband who watches porn and shoots blanks.

My mind churned and roiled. Half a thought of suicide flashed through. I would have no legacy. There was no meaning to my existence.

When I reached home, I dumped the test results on the dining table. There was no use hiding it. I had resigned myself from our relationship. I was ready to let her go and I expected the worst.

I walked up the stairs to our bedroom. I took a swig from the bottle of Jack Daniels in my cabinet. No need to be decent and pour myself a drink like a responsible drinker. I followed that up with a few more. I used to be teetotaller most of my adult life. Drinks were only for special occasions. I was beat and drunk in 10 minutes flat.

I laid myself down and I was out. When I woke up it was already 9 AM in the morning. Way too late for me. I lay there sulking. I didn't feel like going to work. I turned to my side and realised that my wife was lying next to me. I wondered why? She was a morning person just like me.

I had been pretending to be sleeping. I slowly opened my eyes to look at her. She was peering on to my face. There was no sign of anger and sadness.

"Good morning I said" with the guilt of a hangover

She caressed my face with her right hand.

"I saw the lab results. The doctors office had called me on your way to their office."

I looked on silently. I had nothing for her

"It's OK. We can get through this." she sniffled.

"I am sorry for everything." I said with tears rolling down my eyes

"Don't be." She said with compassion.

"The baby... We can't have a baby."

"There are other ways."

"Other ways...???"

"We can adopt, if nothing works. We can give a better life to an orphan. Maybe that's our calling"

I was stumped by her kindness.

I lay there staring into her eyes. They were endless pools of blue that knew no depth.

I kissed her on the cheek lightly. She kissed me back on my lips.

"Did you have a word with Amy. I'm sorry she had to see it"

"I did. It's OK. She forgives you and I forgive you too."

"You sure, you won't be going back to that" She asked me with a bit of mischief

"I don't plan to" I confessed

"Yeah.... But even the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry" Robert Burns, she said

I recognized the phrase. It sounded familiar.

"You are really not mad at me any more?"

"Who said anything about that? I forgive, but I don't forget" she smirked.

"Ok"

"OK then" she intoned

I bit my lip nervously.

"You should go to work. Your mind needs to be occupied"

I nodded in agreement. I guess that went fairly well. I thought to myself

I went to work, but I just couldn't concentrate. None of my research students had showed up that day. There was a flu making the rounds and they wanted to stay safe. I had the entire lab all to myself. I decided to check out the sanctum web site just one more time. I was intrigued by what went on there. I could only imagine how wild the parties must be in one of their club houses. One thing led to another and I found myself trapped in a cuckold story that I had downloaded on my kindle. I was openly fondling myself, because there was no one to bother me. Even though I had promised my wife that I would never look at porn again, I had gone from bad to worse. My new thing was edging. Getting hard for hours without orgasming and I had the whole day to myself.


Suddenly, my office door was pried open. Jez wanted to surprise me and she got me a gourmet sandwich. I stood up to welcome her not realizing that my stubby little erection was poking from the inside of my slacks. If that was not enough, the front was stained with precum. She looked at my erection funnily and then at me. I covered my erection hastily but it was too late. It hadn't gone unnoticed.

She didn't say anything as she sat down in the opposite end. She paused for a few seconds her face furrowed. I knew that the worst was yet to come.

"Are you crazy? Why are you masturbating at work? Don't you have any self respect or decency? Is this what you do all day? Oh God!!! What has gone wrong with you Pete???" She was screaming knowing that there was no one in the lab

The truth is, yeah, I do occasionally screw up, but I was very good at what I do. I reconciled that most intelligent people had kinks that they should not display in public. But I was not going to play that line to my wife.

"It's not like that Jez. There is no one here. It's just me in the office today"

"You could have been home spending time with the family, but instead this is what you choose to do!!!"

"Shheeesh, What am I going to say? My husband goes to work so that he can masturbate???"

"I'm sorry" I said but I knew that it was water under the bridge

"You are sorry about what Pete? Getting caught? How long has this been going on? Tell me the truth?"

"I am stressed. I can't help it... "

"Yeah, tough luck mister. I guess I should find something to do too to relieve my stress."

She was clearly angry. Her cheeks had turned a pale shade of reddish pink. Her lips were quivering. But at that moment I found her all the more attractive. Her eyes were cloudy and watery.A second later the flood gates had opened and she was crying hard.

"You don't love me any more, do you?"

"I do... I do... I wish I could explain myself.... If I had a gun I would just shoot myself. I feel worthless. How can I..."

I had nothing more to say... I looked down and covered my face with both of my hands. I couldn't face her any more. I was an addict in denial. It was time to confess.

"I am addicted to porn. I am sorry. I relapsed. I don't know what to do. It's not you. I love you... It's me. I've been this way for a long time."

"I'll go for counselling..."

She got up. Reached out for my hand gently. I held her and I followed her back to our cars and we both drove home.

Later that night in bed she seemed to have calmed down.

"You know, I've been thinking, maybe I've been too hard on you and I'm sorry. I know guys like to watch porn. You can promise all you want, but I know you are going to be watching it again."

I had nothing to add to that but I was strangely relieved

"We could watch it together. I would feel less guilty then." I don't know what I was thinking as I blurted it out. I bit my tongue to punish myself.

"You think that will help? I can be your partner in crime, if that's what you want" I could trace a smile on her lips

"Really!!! You wouldn't mind" I asked incredulously, voicing more excitement than I should.

"Yeah, why not. We are in this together. Aren't we?"

"I suppose." I was overflowing with love for this woman.

"You are not just my wife, you are so much more. I can't believe I am having this conversation with you. It's like you've seen my heart"

"Indeed I have Pete. You have no idea." This time she smiled broadly. It was friendly and warm.

I kissed her and she kissed me back. It was like falling in love all over again.

We made love that night. For the first time in my marriage, I was sporting an erection from pure love, not lust from my wacky fantasies.

The next day was a Saturday. Amy had gone out to hang out with her friends. We had the house to ourselves. I was having breakfast and noticed that Jez had  gone upstairs.

I followed her upstairs after breakfast. I found her in the study room. She was on the computer and I noticed that she was browsing through one of my cuckold sites. I was OK telling her that I am addicted to porn, but cuckold porn, that was something entirely different.

Fortunately the movie that she was previewing at the moment was an interracial video. Not too obvious, I thought.

As I entered the room she looked back at me and smiled. I smiled back nonchalantly. I stood behind her as she watched the action on the screen.

"This is what you like" She asked me shyly.

"Some of it. Yeah"

"You mind if I look at your stuff?"

"Be my guest" I said it like everything was fine. But I feared that she might connect the dots.

Jessica has a secret past that Pete had never been privy to. Pete though that he had wooed Jessica, but the truth was anything but that. Pete was simply a pawn to the powers that be.

Jessica

I had a sheltered life. I never knew what my mom did for a living when I was young but it seemed like it was important work. Niick  worked as a accountant in a multinational corporation. I didn't quite understand how my mom made so much more money than my dad. One thing that I remember is that my dad was quite docile and almost always deferred his judgement in favour of mom. My dad was called Nick and my mom was called Catherine. Nick was really a kind soul. He took care of me when I was young. I know it's weird for a daughter to refer to her dad by name. But, that's how he liked me to call him. Nick helped me with my homework, took me to the movies, washed the clothes and did the dishes. For all I knew, I've never questioned his subservience until much later in life but Nick was my favourite. He had a great influence on my outlook on men.

Mom was different. She was a fashionista and I got my fashion sense from her. We grew close to each other around the time that I hit my puberty. Until then it was Nick who chauffeured me around. We grew really close to each other. Towards the end, she was my closest confidant. She taught me things and opened my eyes. She changed my perspective about life. I am who I am because of her. Mom was sexy to say the least. Nick says that she was so beautiful. In her twenties and thirties she had the delicate features of a runway model. He said that he was so proud to be married to her, especially because she had the grace and charm to attract attention where ever she went.

Mom was not a prude  and I am glad that she wasn't. She treated me like an adult early on in life. She respected me for who I was. Because of her I was far mature than most girls my age. Six months after I hit puberty she had a candid talk with me about the birds and the bees. Except that, unlike other mothers, she gave me the colourful version. Maybe a bit more than I cared to know, nevertheless it was an eye opener for me. When she took me out for shopping, she made sure that I had the trendiest of clothes. Sexy, but elegant.

By the time I reached 15, we were more or less like girlfriends. It wasn't unusual for me to find her flirting with other men and she would in turn encourage me to flirt with other boys. I am not boasting when I say that I am really good at the art of seduction. I had learned from the best. She helped me to get comfortable wearing sexy clothes. She told me that a women's body was like a paradise. Use it skilfully and you could have the world at your feet. Her exact words were "A successful women is literally a man trap. No matter how confident or successful he is."

I came to know what my mom's real job was around this time. She belonged to an exclusive club simply know as "The Circle". She had rose to become a senior member of the club. Her calling card simply said "Negotiator". Simply put, she made things happen. The Circle was not just any club filled with some rich fucks. It was an exclusive club comprised of the creme de la creme of society. Their reach and influence transcended countries and billion dollar companies. They actively recruited the influencers and news makers into their fold. It was a cut throat organization purely driven by profits and personal goals. To become a member of the organization you had to bring considerable value.

The Circle had many franchises. They were a very secretive organization and most of their activities were hidden from the public. The face of the organization was an exclusive sex club called the Sanctum. Sanctum held elaborate orgies and live productions of erotic events. Members of the club had to choose the left hand path, represented by the all seeing eye. Members were free to chose between atheism or a theistic God. Their traditions included scared rituals from Hinduism, the Kaballah and The Satanic Temple. They were rebels at heart and they tried to stay true to their human nature. They believed in materialism and abhorred spiritualism. Especially the Christian version of it.

Mom said that she made things happen. It means that she influenced and persuaded people to bend to her will. The club recruits men and women of exceptional calibre and puts them through a rigorous training to become negotiators.  For obvious reasons they preferred men and women who were atypically beautiful with a good measure of self confidence. I came to appreciate the nature of her work more clearly when I myself got inducted into the organization. I have come to realize that there are no absolutes like good or bad and black or white. Most of what we do lie in the grey area. We do what we have to as long as it meets our personal goals or the goals of the organization. Therefore, its perfectly acceptable to lie, deceive, bribe and seduce to achieve our goals. Most of these activities take part while negotiating global policies between countries or striking deals with multimillion dollar companies. As a policy, the club rarely engages in the pursuit of revenge or punishing individuals. Not because they have play fare or because they follow ethics. They don't because it is an unproductive effort.

Back to my mom's flirty behaviour. At first I was confused, knowing that she was a married women. When I asked her about it. She smiled affectionately.

"You my little girl have a lot to learn" She placed her palm on mine and squeezed it lightly. I smiled back.

"We have a little arrangement. When mom wants to play, Nick looks the other way" There was mischief written all over her face.

"He doesn't mind??" I asked in suspense

"He did.... Initially... But we worked it out.."

"Does that mean he also..." She didn't let me finish the sentence.

"Nooooo.....   What kind of a husband would that make him?" She said reproachfully

"I don't understand..."

"You will... In time..."

"Nick is a very special guy... But he is not who you think he is.."

I didn't really know how to respond to that but mom continued...

"We have a lot to talk about sweetie, So much to learn..."

She moved closer to me

"Tell me about that boyfriend of yours. What's his name Alan?"

"We are just friends... He is ... Nice to me"

"Ah... Nice guy huh?"

"So, you haven't really done anything yet?"

"Mom!!!" I replied a bit miffed.

"It's OK sweetie.. We can talk, can't we?"

I calmed down and gave in

"We want to take it slow"

"Hmmm, that's the problem with nice guys... They are always slow. Just like little Nicky"

I didn't miss her belittling nick. Just that it didn't register too well.

"Mom... It's not a big deal"

"Sweetie... It's actually a big deal...You are young... If you are not having fun...then you are wasting your life"

"But I'm having fun mom... He loves me and I love him too..."

"Well that's really cute. But, aren't you at least curious? I remember my first time. It was with a cute boy..."

"God, I hated it..."

"So, you never did it after???"

"Not for a while... But then I met a not so nice guy... A rude African American kid... He was a few years older than me.... I hated him so much... But it was the best sex ever"

"Mom.... You said the S world... Nick is going to be so mad, if he were here"

"Don't be silly my child... I would never use that word in front of him!!!" She covered her mouth. I could see that she was trying to contain a smile.

"But he is not here, is he?" She glanced at me and grinned.

"You should experiment... See what's out there... You know..." she was more serious now

I felt like we were suddenly having an adult conversation. So I hesitated but Mom picked up on my thoughts.

"Mom, I want to, but I...."

"Shhh.. Don't say anything sweetie. I know exactly what you mean. You don't want to come across as being too forward."

I looked at her and I felt like a weight was lifted of my chest. It's true. I've been more than curious and I wanted to experience it. Making love with Alan. But I felt like he was holding back and I didn't want to push the envelope

"He is so shy Mom. How can I..."

"Simple...Find a guy who is not so shy"

"But he is my boyfriend"

"So...!!! You never know, Alan might be a special boy like little Nicky"

"Oh no... I don't think so mom.. He is very sensitive. I don't want to hurt him"

"Well it wouldn't hurt him, if he doesn't know"

"Mom, you can't be telling me to cheat on him. You are so bad" I was actually feeling a bit sad and irritated at where this was going. I looked away from her

"Look at me sweetie. Listen... It's not a big deal. That's how it was with Nicky in the beginning. He got on the programme, didn't he"

"But Alan is not Nick..."

"That's why you have to train him."

"Mom... You are loosing me... I don't...."

Mom hugged me and ran her fingers down my hair until I calmed down. She spoke to my ear still hugging me.

"The world will tell you that men can stray while women should remain chaste. That world is fading fast. The world that we live in has 2 kinds of people and its not divided by sex. They are the Entitled  and the Losers. The gods and goddesses versus the slaves."

"You and me, we are entitled. Our bodies are like shrines to be worshipped. We give ourselves to powerful, healthy and virile men who can play us like master violinists. People like nicky and your allen will beg to stand by wayside and listen to the music we create"

She released my shoulder and held my face in her arms and stroked my cheeks lightly and looked at me with love.

"Honey, you trust me right?"

"Yes mom... Off course"

"I want you to meet a young man. He is a bit older than you, but you'll like him. I'm very close with his father" she smiled and paused "If you know what I mean"

I smiled back knowingly.

"Nicky is a good man, for the most part. But he is no good where it counts. So we reached an agreement. You follow..."

"I guess so..."

"You know the reason he doesn't get to play is because he is no good. Even if he wanted to, no one would play with him. We tried swinging a couple of times. It was really embarrassing..."

"Why?" I quizzed her with genuine curiosity

"Because he pissed of his partners. They were not enjoying hanging out with him"

"Ohh..."

"He is really small down there... And he can't keep it up..."

"Anyway, that's when we decided or rather I decided for him... That he shouldn't join me any more... "

"Just like that mom?"

"Honey... You can't imagine how good that turned out for me. I mean nicky accepted it and accepted me as I am. I feel like the luckiest woman in the world."

"Why because you could sleep around..." I pondered loudly

"Yeah... It's true... Sometimes I feel sorry for him...but... I don't care. The club helped out a lot. I learned to shed my guilt and embrace my inner woman."

"How did the club help?" I wanted to keep the conversation going... Because I was really curious now."

"Because the club taught me to care for myself. I learnt to want things for myself, even if it was selfish. You have one life... If we can't enjoy that life to the fullest, then why bother. They made me to realize that it was OK to manipulate nicky,  demoralise him and speak less of him, so that I can have a fuller life"

"I don't think that is fair mom.... He is your husband"

"You know, I've never looked the other way and if I know any better "
