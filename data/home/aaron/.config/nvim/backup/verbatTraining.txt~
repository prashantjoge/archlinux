Introduction
Need for skills development (Verbat recognizes the need to upgrade the skills  of its employees so that it can stay ahead of the competition. Indirectly, it also ensures the professional growth of its employees as well as surpass abundantly their current market value)
Something for everyone (It is not enough that this skill rejuvenation activity be siloed to individuals or groups. This program is meant to accommodate Developers, BA's, QA's, Designers & Project managers)
Full stack developers (We have fostered a culture of isolation. We have OpenSource and .net developers. We need to break away from this mould and instead have ONE team that can speak the same language, no matter what technology is employed.)
Expertise in one but practitioner knowledge in complimentary skills ( Obviously a PHP developer cannot become an expert designer. A designer cannot become project manager, but there are areas where their roles overlap.  )
