""" Conditional probability
P(A) means probability of event A

P(B|A)= Event A has already occurred, what is the chance of event B. Also
known as conditional probability

P(A,B) or P(A and B) = A and B are independent events
Probability of event A and B P(A,B)
P(A,B) = P(A) * P(B|A) - (1)
P(A,B) = P(A|B) * P(B)

Probability of event A times the probability of event B given event A
Also,
P(A|B) = P(A,B) / P(B) - (3)
P(B|A) = P(A,B) / P(A)
As opposed to independent probability

When 2 events E and F are independent
P(A,B)=P(A)P(B) - (3)
i.e. two independent events like a coin toss.
Also
P(A|B)=P(A) -(4)
