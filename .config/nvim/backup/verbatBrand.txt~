Unlike conglomerate's or Multinational's, Verbat does not have unlimited resources to support branding and marketing activities. Hence it needs to take a nimble and effective approach that delivers the most value for money expended. A few suggestions to build brand value are discussed below

1. Signage and Branding. Create Sign Board's and Sign Post's with a catch phrase (Ex. "Technology in Motion", "Technology @ Work", "Technology Verbified", "Technologizing Tomorrow", "Tomorrow's Tech. Today" etc. ). The former to be displayed on the building and the latter to be displayed on the roadside. Design should be crisp and exemplifies simplicity. Why: For obvious reasons.
2. Accessorize and More. Accessories and Apparel's for employees (Branded company T-shirts, pens, caps, bags, water bottle, vehicle stickers etc. ). Employees are walking advertisement's.  Why: When employees accessorize themselves with company paraphernalia, they create the perception of value through emotional attachments.
3. Productize Employees, Scrap 8-5. Encourage Work from home days with the caveat that it may not be abused. Encourage employees to create a task list for their "Work from Home" days. Why: save electricity, save commute time, increase productivity through implied trust & responsibility, happier employees translate to happier families, increases morale & pride. WFH absolves the 9-6 rule, instead it creates responsible employees.
4. Founder's Day. Celebrate the company, it's employees. Create memories and fodder for thought. It does not have to be an expensive affair that will cost the company $$$. Rather make it a communal event where expenses are shared between the company and it's employees. Distribute memorable and embossed certificates (or trophies) etc that can serve as mantelpieces. Why: It creates a sense of identity and attachment. Well decorated Awards and Certificates of merits are often displayed as objects of pride and fulfilment.
5. Holiday gifts and greetings to important clients. Why: Besides the obvious, they serve as relics that export your ideas, thoughts and memories. Greetings can vary from  edible treats to company notepads, pens etc.
6. Recruit Hyper Locally. Place job adverts in local newspapers. There are a vast majority of applicants who still use newspapers to prospect for jobs. Why: Job adverts serve as a subversive mechanism to advertise the company brand.
7. Content Matters... A LOT. Krishna routinely creates content for social media; while it has value in improving SEO rankings, it has minimal impact in creating awareness or customer retention. Instead create at least one or two high quality articles per month that can be published on LinkedIn. An option would be to encourage employees to create unique content. Offer a cash prize (Min Rs. 100) for creating authentic content. Judgements can be made based on the number of likes and reposts that the published article receives. Why: Creates more opportunities to foster talent, create new avenues to reach social media.
8. Celebrate Milestones. Employees are the most precious resources that a company owns. Celebrate employee work anniversaries and birthdays. Create artful images of employees and publish in social media, congratulating them with appropriate messages. Why: Evangelize new recruits. Let people know that Verbat is an exciting company to work for.
9. Go Social with a cause. Celebrate company achievements through infographics. Create posters with statistical facts on important projects. Get client recommendations and references. Obtain permission from clients to use branded images. Publish achievements on social media when ever appropriate. Ask clients to recommend Verbat on LinkedIn. Create profiles of high value clients. Why: Existing clients as well as future prospects will gain confidence for being vested with Verbat.
10. Campaign Management. Harvest email addresses and create email campaigns. Create social media contests and freebies that users can sign up for (PDF Books, lucky draw, movie tickets etc.)... To harvest email address's. Why: Typical email campaigns focus on selling products or services and they get dismissed into the trash can almost immediately. Email campaigns from Verbat should focus on providing useful information. This should be coupled with relevant blog posts.
11. Transparency and Empowerment: Commit to an annual briefing of the status of companies progress with employees. This could be part of the founder's day message. This should include at a high level, the projects that went well, revenue streams, expenses. What could have gone better. What can be done to get the company to a better position etc. This is just a recommended format. Think of it as an annual performance review of the company. Why: Performance reports delivered by management usually do not create lasting impressions for large companies. But it has the reverse effect on small companies. It provides a framework to on-board management and employees onto a common platform where expectations can be managed. Adopting new policies and practices becomes much more amenable when every one is one the same page.
12. Relationship Management. The Director of the company should strive to have a more intimate and personal relationship with the employees. To start off, this could mean that he/she should at least have a group conference call every two months with the employees. Why: For the most part, "The Director" is detached from the employees thus creating the Christian notion of an unseen "Father in Heaven" and his "Children". Getting involved establishes trust, increases loyalty and productivity. It also displays care and plays on the notion of equality.
13. Community Mobilization. Create awareness in the media by participating in communal events. Example Marathons, Charitable events, Blood Cross donation camps, Donation towards orphans & widows etc. This will be corroborated with press releases and social media announcements. Why: Verbat is like a frog in a pond. It is completely unaware of what goes on around it. Participating in communal events forges new relationships. It helps raise awareness of the entity that is Verbat.
14. Create Brand Ambassadors. Employees with long tenures have a vested interest in the growth of the company. Employees who have a "sense of belonging" will inevitable show their enthusiasm verbally and emotionally and their enthusiasm is contagious. Why: Brand ambassadors improve the image of the company and unwittingly invite new. Practical implementation includes recognition and periodic encouragement and praise. Frequent employment of the same methods of appreciation tend to become stale over time, hence it requires some amount of creativity from management.
15. Re-marketing campaign's. This is an obvious choice. A search on Google that results in a click on Verbat will follow the individual across devices and browsers. Why: Even if the customer dismisses the recommended links, they will be forced to reconsider the option or objectively dismiss the option after careful consideration.
16. Giving b4 Getting: Share knowledge by giving free tips and advice. Educating and teaching potential clients will create a perception of leadership. It will also create fans who will engage in word of mouth referral's. Why: Customers may initially dismiss free advice but will eventually learn to respect the source. Even if the advice results in a lose of business, it creates a burden of liability on the beneficiary.
